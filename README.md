# CoreteX Engine (CorteXngin)

## About The Project

CoreteX Engine (CorteXngin) is an ambitious project aimed at developing a functional, streamlined, simple and lightweight game engine. While initially conceived as an educational endeavor to explore graphics development and technologies like OpenGL, the project has evolved into a comprehensive game engine initiative. Currently in its nascent stages, CoreteXEngine is a long-term undertaking, with the majority of componentsâ€”including memory allocation, mathematical functions, and data structures - being developed from the ground up.

The vision for CoreteXEngine encompasses a sophisticated renderer independent of specific graphics libraries, a physics engine, a modern editor interface, and various other technologies essential for a versatile and self-sufficient game development platform. Although the project is in its early phases, it represents a significant commitment to creating a fully-fledged, independent game engine ecosystem.

### Built With

* C++20
* OpenGL 3.3

## Getting Started

To build and run the engine follow these simple example steps.

### Requirements

* Visual Studio 2022 
* MSVC v143 build toolset (included into Windows SDK)
* CMake

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/noubuddy/CoreteXEngine.git
   ```
2. Go to the root directory
   ```sh
   cd CoreteXEngine
   ```
3. Generate VS2022 solution files
   ```sh
   ./GenerateSolutionFiles.bat
   ```

Once these steps are completed, a CorteXngin.sln file should be generated in the project directory.

### Build and Run

1. Run RunDebug script to build and launch the project
   ```sh
   ./RunDebug.bat
   ```

After the build process completes, the engine will launch automatically. Alternatively, you can open the CorteXNgine.sln file with Visual Studio 2022 and run the engine directly from the development environment.

## Roadmap
